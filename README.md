# Old Repo!
Due to issues with WiFiManager (most likely caused by my implementation) I no longer use this firmware in my setup. I instead use a simplified version that has all of the same fetaures but just can't be configured remotely.

You can find the new version here: https://github.com/Dullage/SwitchedSonoffSimple
